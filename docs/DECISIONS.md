# Architectural Decisions

## ADR-001: Source package layout

Use `src/quantscope` so tests import the installed package rather than the repository directory.

## ADR-002: Framework-independent numerical core

Keep quantization arithmetic and metrics independent from PyTorch-specific quantization integration.

## ADR-003: Fictional hardware profile

Use an illustrative hardware profile and never claim it represents proprietary Quadric hardware.

## ADR-004: Metric provenance

Label results as measured, simulated, or estimated.
